	 * In this section, we present the concept of streams in Java and show how they are used for
input/output (I/O) processing. I/O refers to the nature of how data is accessed, either by
reading the data from a resource (input), or writing the data to a resource (output). This
section will focus on the common ways that data is input and output using fi les accessed by
streams.
Note that the I/O streams that we discuss in this chapter are data streams and
completely unrelated to the new Stream API that you saw in Chapter 4 , “Functional
Programming.” Even we agree that the naming of the new Stream API can be a little
confusing when discussing I/O streams.
Stream Fundamentals
The contents of a fi le may be accessed or written via a stream, which is a list of data elements
presented sequentially. Streams should be conceptually thought of as a long, nearly never-ending
“stream of water” with data presented one “wave” at a time.
It may be helpful to visualize a stream as being so large that all of the
data contained in it could not possibly fit into memory. For example, a 1
terabyte file could not be stored entirely in memory by most computer
systems (at the time this book is being written). The file can still be read
and written by a program with very little memory, since the stream allows
the application to focus on only a small portion of the overall stream at any
given time.
We demonstrate this principle in Figure 8.2 . The stream is so large that
once we start reading it, we have no idea where the beginning or the end
is. We just have a pointer to our current position in the stream and read
data one block at a time.
412 Chapter 8 ■ IO
Each type of stream segments data into a “wave” or “block” in a particular way. For
example, some stream classes read or write data as individual byte values. Other stream
classes read or write individual characters or strings of characters. On top of that, some
stream classes read or write groups of bytes or characters at a time, specifically those with
the word Buffered in their name.

all Java streams use bytes
Although the java.io API is full of streams that handle characters, strings, groups of
bytes, and so on, nearly all are built on top of reading or writing an individual byte or
an array of bytes at a time. The reasoning behind more high-order streams is for 
convenience as well as performance.
For example, writing a file one byte at a time is time consuming and slow in practice
because the round-trip between the Java application and the file system is relatively
expensive. By utilizing a BufferedOutputStream, the Java application can write a large
chunk of bytes at a time, reducing the round-trips and drastically improving performance.
Although streams are commonly used with file I/O, they are more generally used to
handle reading/writing of a sequential data source. For example, you might construct a Java
application that submits data to a website using an input stream and reads the result via an
output stream.
In fact, you have been using streams since your first “Hello World” program! Java provides
three built-in streams, System.in, System.err, and System.out, the last of which we have
been using to output data to the screen throughout this book. We will discuss these three
streams in detail later in this chapter when we discuss user input.
Stream Nomenclature
The java.io API provides numerous classes for creating, accessing, and manipulating
streams—so many that it tends to overwhelm most new Java developers. Stay calm! We will
review the major differences between each stream class and show you how to distinguish
